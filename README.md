To protect user data, companies often encourage customers to create strong passwords. But what exactly makes a password strong? In general, a strong password is one that combines uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. For example, a password like Yvkhgzm569^ is considered secure due to its complexity.
To simplify the process of generating strong passwords for myself, I wrote a Python program that automates it. I'm sharing this tool for anyone who might also find it useful. The program allows users to customize their password by specifying the number of letters, digits, and special characters they want to include.
